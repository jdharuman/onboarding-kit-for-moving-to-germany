# 🏦 Set Up Payments

In Germany, most recurring expenses like rent, insurance, and phone bills require a proper **payment setup**. Here’s how to do it.

## ✅ Steps to Set Up Payments
1. **Get an IBAN (International Bank Account Number)**:
   - Your German bank will provide you with an **IBAN**.
   - This is used for receiving salary and setting up payments.
2. **Set Up SEPA Direct Debit (Lastschrift)**:
   - Many services require **automatic payments** (rent, insurance, internet, etc.).
   - Fill out a **SEPA mandate** to authorize automatic withdrawals.
3. **Use Online Payment Apps (Optional)**:
   - PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay work in Germany.
   - Some local services use **Giropay**.
4. **Manage Cash Payments**:
   - **Germany is still a cash-friendly country**, so keep some cash for small purchases.

## 📜 Additional Tips
- **Rent payments** are usually made via **bank transfer or SEPA direct debit**.
- Some businesses still **don’t accept credit cards**, so have a **debit card or cash** handy.
- Set up **standing orders (Dauerauftrag)** for fixed payments like rent.
